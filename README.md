### Project

This project use the clean architecture, we separate the business logic and the web app.
Business logic is in packages/core and the web app is in packages/web
If tomorrow you want to make a react-native app, we just have to make a packages/react-native-app 
and we can reuse the logic of core to make our new app 

### Start the project 

- `yarn`
- `cd packages/web`
- `yarn start`
